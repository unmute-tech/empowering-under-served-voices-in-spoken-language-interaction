Speech is one of the richest forms of human communication.
But speech-based interactive systems are currently available for only a small fraction of the world’s languages.
Consequently, hundreds of millions of people are being excluded globally.

For the past three years we have worked with so-called "low-resource" language communities, as part of the UnMute research project, to explore responsible and inclusive techniques for developing speech recognition with low data requirements.
In this report we explore the motivations, challenges and benefits of working with under- served communities such as these to develop automatic speech recognition tools and associated interactive services.

We argue for inclusive technology design and data-compilation methods, present our approach, and detail case studies showing examples of its potential.
We provide a toolkit for developing speech technologies for language varieties for which there are—for complex historical and sometimes socio-cultural reasons—very little written, computer-readable text data which would traditionally be required for technology development.
